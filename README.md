The dataset is publicly available on the <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression'>Kaggle website</a> and is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.   
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
